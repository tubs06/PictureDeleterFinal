Gallery viewer and queue deleter, made by Noah McDonell.

This program allows you to open a directory containing a large ammount of PNG or JPG files, and delete ones you do not wish to keep. Normally,
a user would open each image and manually delete each file, which can be a waste of time for large ammounts of images. This program helps alleviate that problem.

You first open a directory containing images wite the "Choose Directory" button, and the program automatically loads in all images and displays them on the right side
in a check list. You can easily go through images with the "Previous" and "Next buttons, or just select images from the check list. You can queue delete by clicking the
"Queue/Unqueue for Delete" button, or check and uncheck the list entry cooresponding to the image. Once you have selected images to delete, you can click the 
"Delete Queued" button to delete them all at once. This program automatically resets when selecting a different directory, or when all images are exhausted. It also detects
faulty image files and removes them from the list automatically when you try to display them in the program.
