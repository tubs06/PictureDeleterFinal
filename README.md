Gallery viewer and queue deleter, made by Noah McDonell.

This program allows you to open a directory containing a large ammount of PNG or JPG files, and delete ones you do not wish to keep. Normally,
a user would open each image and manually delete each file, which can be a waste of time for large ammounts of images. This program helps alleviate that problem.
